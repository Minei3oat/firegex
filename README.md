## What is Firegex?
Firegex is a firewall that includes different functionalities, created for CTF Attack-Defence competitions that has the aim to limit or totally deny malicious traffic through the use of different kind of filters.

## Get started firegex
What you need is a linux machine and docker ( + docker-compose )
```bash
sh <(curl -sLf https://pwnzer0tt1.it/firegex.sh)
```
With this command you will download firegex.py, and run it, it will require you the password to use for firegex and start it with docker-compose

Or, you can start in a similar way firegex, cloning this repository and executing this command
```bash
python3 start.py
```
Cloning the repository start.py will automatically build the docker image of firegex from source, and start it.
Image building of firegex will require more time, so it's recommended to use the version just builded and available in the github packages.
This is default behaviour if start.py is not in the firegex source root directory.

By default firegex will start in a multithread configuration using the number of threads available in your system.
The default port of firegex is 4444. At the startup you will choose a password, that is essential for your security.
All the configuration at the startup is customizable in [firegex.py](./start.py) or directly in the firegex interface.

## Functionalities

- Regex filtering using [NFQUEUE](https://netfilter.org/projects/libnetfilter_queue/doxygen/html/) with [nftables](https://netfilter.org/projects/nftables/) uses a c++ file that handle the regexes and the requests, blocking the malicius requests. PCRE2 regexes are used. The requests are intercepted kernel side, so this filter works immediatly (IPv4/6 and TCP/UDP supported)
- Create basic firewall rules to allow and deny specific traffic, like ufw or iptables but using firegex graphic interface (by using [nftable](https://netfilter.org/projects/nftables/))
- Port Hijacking allows you to redirect the traffic on a specific port to another port. Thanks to this you can start your own proxy, connecting to the real service using the loopback interface. Firegex will be resposable about the routing of the packets using internally [nftables](https://netfilter.org/projects/nftables/)

### Main Points of Firegex
#### 1. Efficiency
Firegex should not slow down the traffic on the network. For this the core of the main functionalities of firegex is a c++ binary file.
#### 2. Availability
Firegex **must** not become a problem for the SLA points!
This means that firegex is projected to avoid any possibility to have the service down. We know that passing all the traffic through firegex, means also that if it fails, all services go down. It's for this that firegex implements different logics to avoid this. Also, if you add a wrong filter to your services, firegex will always offer you a fast or instant way to reset it to the previous state.

## Why "Firegex"?
Initiially the project was based only on regex filters, and also now the main function uses regexes, but firegex have and will have also other filtering tools.
