                ‚öôÔ∏è How to use Netfilter Proxy
            </Title>
            <Text size="lg">
                To use Netfilter Proxy, simply create and upload a Python
                filter. The filter is passed to the C++ binary, which then
                processes packets using the provided logic. This allows you to
                tailor the filtering behavior to your needs.

                üí° How to write pyfilters?
            </Title>
            <Text size="lg">
                First of all install the firegex lib and update it running{" "}
                <Code>pip install -U fgex</Code>. After that you can use{" "}
                <Code>firegex</Code> module.
                <CodeHighlight
                    code={IMPORT_CODE_EXAMPLE}
                    language="python"
                    my="sm"
                />
                With this code we imported the <Code>pyfilter</Code> decorator
                and the <Code>ACCEPT</Code> and <Code>REJECT</Code> statements.
                <br />
                Let's create a first (useless) filter to see the syntax:
                <CodeHighlight
                    code={FOO_FILTER_CODE}
                    language="python"
                    my="sm"
                />
                You see that the filter must be decorated with the{" "}
                <Code>pyfilter</Code> decorator and must return a statement
                about how to manage that packet.
                <br />
                <Space h="sm" />
                You can save every data about the current flow in the global
                variables, the code you write will be executed only once for
                flow. The globals variables are isolated between flows. For each
                packet the filter functions will be called with the required
                paramethers and using the same globals as before.
                <br />
                <Space h="sm" />
                <strong>
                    Saving data in globals of other modules is not recommended,
                    because that memory is shared by the flows managed by the
                    same thread and lead to unexpected behaviors.
                </strong>
                <br />
                <Space h="sm" />
                <strong>
                    Global variables that starts with '__firegex' are reserved
                    for internal use, don't use them.
                </strong>
                <br />
                <Space h="sm" />
                You can manage when the function is called and also getting some
                data specifying some paramethers, using type decorators. Default
                values of the paramethers will be ignored, also kvargs values
                will be ignored.
                <br />
                <Space h="sm" />
                <strong>
                    Functions with no type decorator are considered invalid
                    pyfilters!
                </strong>
                <br />
                <Space h="sm" />
                <CodeHighlight
                    code={TYPING_ARGS_EXAMPLE}

                    my="sm"
                />
                In this code we are filtering all the http requests that
                contains the word "ILLEGAL" in the body. All the other packets
                will be accepted (default behavior). The function will be called
                only if at least internally teh HTTP request header has been
                parsed, and also when the body will be parsed.
                <br />
                <Space h="sm" />
                If we have multiple paramether, the function will be called only
                if with the packet arrived is possible to build all the
                paramethers.

                üîß How can I test the filter?
            </Title>
            <Text size="lg">
                You can test your filter by using <Code>fgex</Code> command
                installed by firegex lib: This will run a local proxy to a
                remote destination with the filter you specified.
                <br />
                <Space h="sm" />
                This can be done by running for instance:{" "}
                <Code>
                    fgex nfproxy test_http.py 127.0.0.1 8080 --proto http
                </Code>
                <CodeHighlight code={HELP_NFPROXY_SIM} language="" my="sm" />
                You don't need to restart the proxy every time you change the
                filter, the filter will be reloaded automatically.
